                  <p>She froze in an instant and squirmed away from me. "You're a lunatic! Jerk! You're an ugly son of a-" I removed the cover on her head and watched her mouth slack open as she blinked in a confused daze at me. I heard her breath hitch as she took a good look at my face. We studied each other for a while.</p>
                  <p>Her gray eyes took in my features. She licked her thin lips nervously and asked, "What color are your eyes. They are the strangest green."</p>
                  <p>I smirked at her. "They're called forest green princess." Before she could ask another question, I took her in my arms and hauled her to the bedroom. It was not without difficulty of course. She kept wriggling against me and even threatened to bite me. What a charming princess, I thought in disdain.</p>
                  <p>Once we were inside the bedroom, which would be her holding room or her cell if you want to call it that, I set her down on the bed where she squirmed some more. I looked her in the eyes. "If you want me to untie you, you'll stop twitching like that. You look like a maggot."</p>
                  <p>"I am not!" she said heatedly. I clicked my tongue at her. "Sure you're not princess."</p>
                  <p>She stared daggers at me. "Why did you kidnap me? You're a low life! You're the lowest!" she seethed. I gave her a patronizing look. "And you're a saint princess?" I asked with a smile. "Don't ask questions that you'll regret knowing the answer to."</p>
                  <p>"Are you going to kill me?" she choked. </p>
                  <p>"If I wanted to, I would have done it a long time ago. So to answer your question, no I'm not going to kill you. But I am going to hold you here for a long time. Look around you princess. Stare at the four corners of this room because you'll get to memorize it while you're here."</p>
                  <p>I pointed to the windows. "Those are barred. Even if you cut that lovely honey colored hair of yours to make a Rapunzel-like rope, you'll never escape from here." I tilted my chin to the door where she followed with her gaze. "That is made with metal and is locked with a security code that only I know of."</p>

                  <p>"Scream all you want," I continued. "This hideout is located miles from any town or road. No one will ever hear you. In this little world of ours, I'm your only friend. I will feed you, talk to you when I want to, and do things that need be. If you're not nice to me, you'll never see the daylight again. Do you understand?"</p>
                  <p>"I despise you," she said savagely. </p>
                  <p>"Well I'm very sorry to hear that," I said with a shrug. "But your attitude will not help you at all princess." I stood up and walked to the door. </p>
                  <p>"Wait!" she called out. "Aren't you going to remove my restraints?" </p>
                  <p>Her question made me smile to myself. "Say please," I said. Her jaw clenched. "Are you freaking kidding me?" she said loudly. </p>
                  <p>"I don't think her highness would appreciate your smart mouth princess." I faced her and grinned widely. "I'll only remove that if you say please." She closed her eyes for an instant and deliberated whether to say it or not. She thought better of it and said, "Please remove it."</p>
                  <p>I walked back to her and leaned down so I could untie the ropes. "See? I know there's some manners left in you," I teased. She pursed her lips and didn't reply. I knew she was angry at me for kidnapping her and doing this. But who cares? I had my own reasons. </p>
                  <p>My hands deftly removed the knots on the rope. Once she was untied, the princess moved her hands around and sat on the edge of the bed. She stunned me by elbowing my stomach and running to the direction of the door. Years of judo training kicked in. I pounced on her and pinned her to the ground where I straddled her.</p>
                 <p>"You shouldn't have done that," I told her. "My stomach is going to bruise. You're lucky that I don't have a photo shoot right now." She writhed against my grip. "What are you saying? Let me go this instant!"</p>
                  <p>"I'm warning you princess. If you do that again, I'll rip your clothes off and let you stay here completely naked." That made her stop. "When I release you, you're going to walk back to the bed. Understand?" She nodded. I stood up and helped her to her feet. She headed to the direction of the bed and sat down as instructed. </p>
